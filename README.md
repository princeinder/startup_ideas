# Startup Ideas

## Server

first you need to have node.js and npm installed
then open a terminal window in the project's folder
type  "npm install" to install the dependencies of the project
then type "node server.js"

## Client
Navigate to client folder
type "npm install && npm start"

you can now open your prefered navigator and type in the url bar "http://localhost:3000"
